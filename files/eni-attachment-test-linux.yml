 description: 'The ENI attachment test creates an ENI and attaches it to the instance. It validates that the attached ENI has an IP address. It then detaches and deletes the ENI. To perform this test, an IAM policy with the following actions is required: ec2:AttachNetworkInterface, ec2:CreateNetworkInterface, ec2:CreateTags, ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface, ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces, ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaceAttribute, and ec2:DetachNetworkInterface.'
